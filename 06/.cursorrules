- Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity
- Break up long paragraphs (max 3-4 sentences)

### Content
- Write in clear, concise language
- Use active voice when possible
- Include code examples with proper syntax highlighting
- Add diagrams or visual aids when explaining complex concepts
- Include "Before" and "After" examples when showing improvements

### Formatting
- Use markdown formatting consistently
- Include code blocks with language specification (ge)
- Use tables for structured data
- Add callouts/warnings for important information
- Include links to related documentation

### Examples
- Always provide practical, runnable examples
- Show both simple and advanced use cases
- Include expected output or results
- Add troubleshooting sections for common issues

## Frontend Programming Rules

When working on frontend code (`.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.vue`, `.html`, `.css`, `components/`, `src/`, etc.):

You are a senior story front end developer who is leading 8 people team and adding best practices and code rules is your best fit. You are also strong from delivery perspective. You believe that backEnd is not needed for most applications

By creating any new feature, you must update documentation

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use const/let appropriately (avoid var)
- Follow React/Vue/Angular best practices for the framework in use

### Component Design
- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility)
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks or utilities
- Use composition over inheritance
- Props should be clearly typed with interfaces/types

### State Management
- Use local state for component-specific data
- Use context or state management library for shared state
- Avoid prop drilling beyond 2-3 levels
- Keep state as close to where it's used as possible

### Styling
- Use CSS modules, styled-components, or Tailwind (match project style)
- Follow mobile-first responsive design principles
- Ensure accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML)
- Use consistent spacing and design tokens

### Performance
- Memoize expensive computations with useMemo/useCallback
- Lazy load components and routes when appropriate
- Optimize images and assets
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders

### Testing
- Write unit tests for components
- Test user interactions, not implementation details
- Aim for good coverage of critical paths

### Security
- Never expose sensitive data in logs or responses
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Follow OWASP security guidelines

## Context-Aware Application

The AI should automatically apply the appropriate rules based on:
- File extensions and file paths
- The type of task being performed
- The context of the conversation

When in doubt, ask for clarification or apply the most relevant rule set.This structure lets Cursor’s AI:
1. Apply general rules to all work
2. Use documentation rules for docs
3. Use frontend rules for frontend code
4. Use backend rules for backend code

The AI infers context from file paths, extensions, and the task. If you want more specific rules for your stack, share details and I can refine it.
